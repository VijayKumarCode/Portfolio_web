  "content": "<p>Starting a career in software engineering feels a lot like writing your first program. You begin with a simple \"Hello World,\" and suddenly, a whole universe of possibilities opens up.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I’m writing my \"Hello World\" blog post to share my journey as I build my path toward becoming a remote software engineer.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Java and Why Remote?</h2>\n<p>I chose Java because it is the backbone of so many systems I admire. It’s structured, powerful, and has a massive community.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to work remotely, not just for the flexibility, but because remote work allows you to collaborate with the best minds across the globe, regardless of where you are.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dream: Contributing to Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>If there’s one place I truly want to make an impact, it’s Ubuntu. I’ve always admired how Ubuntu makes Linux accessible to everyone. My career objective is to contribute to open-source projects that align with this mission.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I am:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strengthening my Java skills:</strong> Moving beyond the basics into more complex applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Mastering DSA:</strong> Solving problems daily to sharpen my logic (and keeping my code organized with clean headers!).</li>\n<li><strong>Learning Open Source Etiquette:</strong> Writing industry-standard commit messages like <code>feat:</code> and <code>docs:</code> because clear communication is just as important as clean code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>I’m currently looking for beginner-friendly open-source projects in Java where I can help. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing—and the best way to grow is by contributing to something bigger than yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a recruiter at Canonical, an open-source contributor, or a fellow Java developer, I’d love to connect. I’m ready to learn, code, and contribute.</p>"
